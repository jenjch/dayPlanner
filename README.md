# Homework 5 - Day Planner

The aim of this assignment was to create a daily planner from 9 am to 5 pm, with ability to type in To Do's in each time slot, which will save to local storage and retain on the page. Each time slot will also be color-coded to reflect whether the time is in the past, current, or in the future.

## Composition of Website and Code

Whenever I could, I used jQuery to code the javascript. The HTML and CSS files were provided. I created a new javascript file. I didn't edit the HTML file (besides linking to my created javascript file and adding a header container) since I added HTML dynamically, and made some minor edits to the CSS file.

## Process

I first read through the moment.js documentation and googled some examples to understand how to utilize this in my javascript for displaying the current time in the header, as well as to later use for the dynamic color coding. 

I did some pseudo coding to break down the steps for creating the rows/columns/classes/ids/data attributes, and for the onclick event/local storage.

When writing out the jQuery code, it was continuous trial and error, and correction, when the code didn't manifest as expected. This helped me learn exactly what the code was doing. Console logging was also helpful when I couldn't easily (and visually) understand what the code was doing.

During and after completing the assignment, I commented out each step of my javascript code, so that when I come back to it, I could understand exactly what I did and why. 

## Deployment

Aftering completing all requirements for the assignment, I did a final update of the files in Github and deployed the website for review.
